ðŸ‘‰ Lazy loading ek optimization technique hai jisme React component ya page tabhi load hota hai jab user usse access kare, instead of sab ek sath load karne ke.

âš¡ Pehle: sab ek hi bundle me load ho jaata tha â†’ first load heavy.
âš¡ Ab (lazy loading): sirf jo component chahiye wahi load hota hai â†’ fast initial load, better UX.
